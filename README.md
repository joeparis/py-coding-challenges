# Coding Challenges

[Coding Challenges](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/intro) are a set of exercises written by [John Crickett](https://www.linkedin.com/company/codingchallenges/) with the goal of helping software engineers level up their skills through deliberate practice.

Each challenge sees us writing a full application or tool, most of which will be based on real world tools and utilities.

The challenges were chosen to be small enough to completed in your spare time over a week or two and yet large enough to be complete working projects and are presented with an introduction explaining the challenge. Where applicable, there is a background section providing a brief introduction to any background knowledge needed to complete the challenge. Afterwards, we are given a detailed explanation of the challenge, followed by some instructions and/or scripts to run to test your solution.
